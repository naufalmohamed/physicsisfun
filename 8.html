An electric circuit is a path in which electrons flow.<br>
When the current flows from positive terminal to negative terminal<br>
of a power source, the circuit is said to be complete.<br>
If this path is interrupted (like,open switch, incomplete wires, etc,.)<br>
the circuit is said to be broken or incomplete.<br>
Many number of devices can be connected to a circuit through
parallel or series connection.<br>
A circuit can be described through a circuit diagram.<br>
A circuit diadram consists of symbols.

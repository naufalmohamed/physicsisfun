Force is a push or a pull that changes the <br>shape, size and state of an object.<br>
Motion is caused due to force.<br>
Friction is the force opposing motion from the opposite direction.<br>
To make a stationary object move, force should be applied.<br>
Inorder to increase the speed of a moving object,<br>
force should be applied in the same direction of motion.<br>
Inorder to stop a moving object force should be applied in the <br>
direction opposite to motion.<br>

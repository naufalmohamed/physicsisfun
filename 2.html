It is impossible to imagine life without light.<br>
Light from sun is the main source of energy for humans.<br>
We see things around us due to light rays that enter our eyes.<br>
White light is made up of seven different colours:<br>
Red,Orange,Yellow,Green,Blue,Indigo,Violet.<br>
Light has got both particle as well as wave nature.<br>
When light passes through prism it splits into its 7 constituent colours.<br>
This is how rainbow is formed.<br>
Unlike sound light does not need a medium to propogate.<br>
But it propogate with different speeds in different media.<br>
This causes refraction.<br>
Twinkling of stars is caused due to atmospheric refraction.

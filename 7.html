Movement of electrons through a conductor constitutes electric current.<br>
Conventional direction of electric current is taken as direction opposite to flow of electrons.<br>
i.e,. from positive terminal to negative terminal of a power source.<br>
SI unit of current is Ampere(A).<br>
A difference in the potential produced by a power source along a conductor
makes the electrons to move and produce current.<br>
This difference in potential is know as potential difference.<br>
SI unit of potential difference is Volts(V).<br>
In a conductor The voltage is directly propotional to the current.<br>
This phenomenon is called Ohm's Law.<br>
Resistance is the property of a conductor to resist the current.<br>
SI Unit of resistance is ohm.<br>

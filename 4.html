Heat is a form of energy.<br>
It can be produced by friction, passing electricity through a resistor etc.,<br>
The heat energy from sun is used in solar cookers.<br>
Heat travels by three methods.<br>
<ol>
<li>conduction:<br>
This happens when two objects with different temperatures are in contact.<br>
Heat flows from the warmer to the cooler object.<br>
<li>Convection:<br>
This is how heat travels in liquids and gases.<br>
Here cooler liquids or gases takes the place of warmer ones.<br>
<li>Radiation:<br>
This is the transfer of heat from one object to another without any contact.<br>
Example, We feel sun's heat without even touching it.</ol>

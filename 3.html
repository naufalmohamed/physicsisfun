Sound is made up of waves.<br>
Sound is produced due to the vibration of objects.<br>
It requires a medium to propogate.<br>
It cannot travel in vacuum.<br>
The number of times an object vibrates in a second is called frequency.<br>
Audible range of frequency for humans is 20Hz-20000Hz.<br>
Sound with frequency below 20Hz is called infra-sound.<br>
Sound with frequency above 20000Hz is called ultra-sound.<br>
Loudness is a characteristic property of sound.<br>
It is measured in decibels (dB).<br>

When a force acts upon an object to cause a displacement of the object,<br>
it is said that work was done upon the object.<br>
SI unit of work is newton-metre or joule(J).<br>
The work done by a constant force of magnitude F on a <br>
point that moves a displacement (not distance) s in the direction of the force is the product,<br>
W = Fs.<br>
Energy is the ability to do work.<br>
SI unit of energy is joule.<br>
There are different types of energy like<br>
Solar energy, Kinetic energy, Thermal energy etc,.<br>
Energy is very important in our day to day life.<br>
For example,We are able to move around and lift objects due to muscular energy.<br>
We are able to use electrical appliances due to elecrical energy.
But Energy can neither be created nor be destroyed.<br>
It can only be converted to other form.<br>
For example, In a bulb electrical energy is converted into heat and light energy.
